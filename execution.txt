# Execution

Most files have their own execution script under /bin folder.
All scripts named submit_XXX.sh are designed to be run in a SuperComputer with Slurm queue system. In order to run the locally, just issue the python commands followed by the correct paths. **Note:** due to the use of many different packages not all files run with the same Python version (some with 2.7, others with 3.5.2 and the rest 3.6), I expect to unify them (or state clearly the version) soon.

FINAL NOTE: when running files manually, do so from inside 'src' or export it to the Python path to ensure all dependencies are met.
